				<p class="content"><div class="border">I am a sophomore pre-med student at Tufts University, on track to graduate in May 2018. My passion is the brain, and I am majoring in Cognitive and Brain Sciences and minoring in Computer Science. At Tufts, I'm a member of the climbing team, the musical event staff, and a research assistent at the Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory. When I am not coding or doing psych research, I'm probably going for a run, climbing rocks, or drinking coffee. My other home is in Charlottesville, Virginia, where most of my time is spent in the Blue Ridge Mountains with my adorable puppy, Teddy.</div></p>
