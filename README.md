*** Portfolio Assignment ***
By: Sophie Loman
Date: 2/9/16

My portfolio contains three files: index.html, bio.html, and resume.html. The CSS and HTML validators claim that all my work has been implemented correctly (or, at the very least, there are no errors), but it is possible some of the styling details could be implemented more efficiently. For instance, I created a separate class to center the links on my homepage, because otherwise they were defaulting to left-justified. I discussed this project with Chelsea Wang and Olivia MacDougal and spent about 6 hours on it.
